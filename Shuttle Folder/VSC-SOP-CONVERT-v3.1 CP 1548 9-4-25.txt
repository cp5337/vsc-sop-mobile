1. GENERAL INFORMATION1.1. Facility OverviewThe Vehicle Security Center (VSC) serves as the primary security screening point for all vehicles accessing the World Trade Center complex. Operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the VSC ensures comprehensive security screening while maintaining efficient traffic flow for commercial deliveries and authorized vehicles.The facility features state-of-the-art screening technology including radiation portal monitors, vehicle X-ray gantries, and explosive detection capabilities. All vehicles entering the complex must pass through the VSC and undergo a complete screening process unless specifically exempted by established protocols.1.2. General Organization of the Vehicle Screening CenterThe Vehicle Security Center operates through eight specialized positions working in concert to ensure comprehensive security screening. Credentialers serve as the first line of defense at entry and exit lanes, verifying all credentials and monitoring radiation detection equipment while managing traffic flow. Screening Inspectors work with explosive detection canine teams to physically inspect privately owned vehicles and verify credentials at Entry Lane 2. Screening Lane Controllers organize vehicle movement through the facility, escorting drivers and passengers while ensuring gantries are properly cleared before scanning operations. Equipment Operators control the X-ray scanning machinery, initiating scans only after receiving clearance confirmation. Image Interpreters: Trained Bomb Technicians, analyze x-ray images and make critical determinations about vehicle clearance or the need for secondary inspection. The Facility Coordinator: The technical liaison, managing maintenance issues and coordinating with WTC departments to ensure operational continuity. The Radiation Safety Officer maintains regulatory compliance with OSHA and state requirements while managing the dosimetry program and monitoring personnel exposure levels. VSC Screening Manager ensures full staffing, equipment functionality, and adherence to security protocols while serving as the primary command authority for the facility's 24-hour operations.1.3. Chain of Commanda. Allied Universal personnel at the VSC operate under the following chain of command:VSC Screening Officer ? VSC Screening Manager ? Project Manager ? WTCS Operations ?

Emergency situations may require immediate action with subsequent notification.1.4. Communication Protocolsa. Effective communication is essential to VSC operations. All personnel must maintain open lines of communication through the methods that follow. b. Handheld radios on designated channelsc. Internal intercom systemd. Landline telephones where availablee. Tour Manager cell phone for managementf. Radio discipline must be always maintained. g. Emergency codes take priority over routine communications.1.5. Safety Requirementsa. All personnel must comply with safety requirements including:b. Wear appropriate PPE, including safety vests in bad weatherc. Always wear a radiation dosimeterd. Steel-toed boots required at operational postse. Follow all OSHA and PANYNJ safety rulesf. Safety incidents must be reported immediately to management and documented appropriately.1.
